# Comments in YAML files are defined by a preceding '#' character
# Provide a comment section at the top with a reference to the study,
# how the data was obtained, and who entered the data. Any anything else
# that may be useful to know. Comments can be used throughout the file.
# Try to keep line length < 80 characters to keep things readable.


# Optionally define a reading frame. I.e. how many characters make up one
#  token? If this parameter is not provided, it defaults to `1`. "ABCD" is a
# string of four tokens when readingframe is '1', but two tokens, AB and CD, if
# readingframe is '2'.
readingframe: 2

# Define strings as a list of "label: string" mappings. A label is something
# you use to refer to a particular string. A string is a sequence of tokens,
#  taking into account the readingframe parameter.
strings:
  - Exposure1: A1A2C1B2B1
  - Exposure2: B1B2C1A2A1
  - Test1: A2A1C1B1B2
  - Test2: B2B1C1A1A2
  - Test3: A2A1C1B2B1
  - Test4: B2B1C1A2A1

# Optionally define categories of strings like below. This can be handy when
# there a groups of strings that have different roles in an experiment.
categories:
  - Exposure: [Exposure1, Exposure2]
  - TestCorrect: [Test1, Test2]
  - TestViolating: [Test3, Test4]

# Optionally define colors that signify categories. This can be handy in
# vizualization, for example in case you want to use the same colors as was
# used in the original publication. Use hexadecimal color code. Note that
# the color codes need double quotes
categorycolors:
    Exposure: "#000077" # blue
    TestCorrect: "#007700" # green
    TestViolation: "#770000" # red

# Optionally define token durations, in seconds.
tokendurations:
    A1: 0.2
    A2: 0.25
    B1: 0.23
    B2: 0.21
    C1: 0.5
    C2: 0.48

# Optionally define fixed duration of silence between tokens, in seconds.
tokenintervalduration: 0.1

# Optionally define comparisons between *two* string categories that are
# made in the publication
categorycomparisons:
    - [Exposure, TestCorrect]
    - [Exposure, TestViolating]
